## Proposed

  * [ ] Multi-dimensional slices within Go itself ([Proposal](https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/6282-table-data.md)).
  * [ ] A robust (and concurrent) package to handle minimizations/fits of data and histograms (gonum/optimize would provide a nice foundation for this).
  * [ ] A robust (and concurrent) package to describe statistical models (Bayesian and frequentist) with many nuisance parameters, etc...
  * [ ] A Go native package for A/B testing.
  * [ ] A database with datalog querying. Inspiration can be drawn from Rich Hickey's [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com) database, but open source.
  * [ ] A datalog query system for distributed computation. Similar to [Cascalog](http://cascalog.org/) for the Hadoop ecosystem, but integrating with some of the Go tools instead.
